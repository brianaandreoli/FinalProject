                    Guidance to overcome negative mindsets. Student-athletes need additional motivation for a continuous drive
                    for their passion. If there is an unhelpful voice going on in a athlete's mind, then I am are here
                    to help them control it. The mind/mindset predicts the actions of someone. The mindset and the way thoguhts
                        appear in someone's head is very important to keep a hold of.</em> </p>

                            <em>I played soccer, basketball, track, flag football, and did karate for 8 years! I was the top scorer in nj for girls soccer 2018-2022.
                                I recieved lots of athlete of the week, all conference, and 1st team all league awards.
                                I have now held records, and over the years continue to break more records. Being a starter player at a young age
                            was a success for me. Gaining all these accomplishments put a toll on my mindset. Along my journey while playing sports, I had to find my strengths while my weaknesses
                                were spotted. I let outside emotions control me during games. Over time I started controlling what
                            I can control. I found coping methods for me to in my everyday life as an athlete. Did things I love to do and that made
                                me happy. I began to build my mindset stronger because with a stronger mindset that negative voice in your head seems to disappear.
                            I started reassuring myself on my strengths during the games. So even on my off days and when I am very
                                stressed out, I will now always remind myself during a game/practice I can still provide my strengths on the field.
                             This is a concern I have for all college student-athletes that try to avoid these negative sturggle, thinking
                            they would disappear. <strong>It is important for these student-athletes to know that social support is always
                            ther efor them, I am there for them! We can build a stronger mindset, and create lots of success for your future!</strong></em>
